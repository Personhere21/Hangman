```bash
g++ -o hangman hangman.cpp
hangman.exe
```

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Run the compiled executable

3. **Read the hint**: Use the clue to help guess the word
4. **Guess letters**: Enter one letter at a time
5. **Win condition**: Guess all letters before running out of attempts

### Error Handling
- Invalid menu choices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"clear" command not found (Windows)**
   - Solution: Code uses `system("cls")` for Windows compatibility

2. **Weird characters displayed**
   - Solution: Emojis have been removed for better terminal compatibility

3. **Input buffer issues**
   - Solution: Proper input buffer management implemented

### Compilation Errors
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed
- Use C++11 or later standard: `g++ -std=c++11 -o hangman hangman.cpp`
